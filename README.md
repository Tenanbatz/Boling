- You are an adventurer who enters the Carcer dungeon. All who enter Carcer Dungeon have never returned, they say men go mad in the endless rooms it holds. There is no return and the only way out is death.  

Random Dungeon Generator Mechanic
Dungeons are made by levels
Num enemies - Randomly generate numbers equal to or less than the character level and subtract it till the character level is 0. Example: If character is level 5 you can have 5 level 1 enemies, 2 level 2 and 1 level 1 enemies, or 1 level 5 enemy, and so on.
Choosing enemies - After the num of enemies has been decided randomly choose enemies from level specific arrays of enemies.(Maybe have a class/method that has a getter for the specific enemy)
